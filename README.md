The input of the program will be the coordinates (coordinates) of the upper left and lower right corner of the two rectangles. The first number is the x-coordinate of the upper left vertex of the rectangle, the secondnumber is the y-coordinate of the upper left vertex of the rectangles. The third number is the x-coordinate of the lower right vertex and the fourth number is the y-coordinate of the lower right vertex. Input parameters (all numbers) are integers from the interval [0; 79]. Individual numbers are separated in the input string by a comma. The input must be programmed by entering four numbers separated by commas of the first rectangle with one enter and four numbers separated by commas of the second rectangle with the other enter - as you can see in the console image (as shown in the figure below).

The following text must be written at the beginning:
Enter the coordinates of the first rectangle (upper left corner, lower right corner):
Enter the coordinates of the second rectangle (upper left corner, lower right corner):

In the event of an input error, the program must be terminated with the error message Error! It is also a mistake that the number was out of range [0; 79] or the second vertex was to the left or higher of the first vertex.
